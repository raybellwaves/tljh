============
Enable HTTPS
============

Every JupyterHub deployment should enable HTTPS!

HTTPS encrypts traffic so that usernames, passwords and your data are
communicated securely. sensitive bits of information are communicated
securely. The Littlest JupyterHub supports automatically configuring HTTPS
via `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`_, or setting it up
:ref:`manually <howto/admin/https/manual>` with your own TLS key and
certificate. Unless you have a strong reason to use the manual method,
you should use the :ref:`Let's Encrypt <howto/admin/https/letsencrypt>`
method.

.. note::

   You *must* have a domain name set up to point to the IP address on
   which TLJH is accessible before you can set up HTTPS.

   To do that, you would have to log in to the website of your registrar
   and go to the DNS records section. The interface will look like something
   similar to this:

Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
==================================

.. note::

   If the machine you are running on is not reachable from the internet -
   for example, if it is a machine internal to your organization that
   is cut off from the internet - you can not use this method. Please
   set up a DNS entry and HTTPS :ref:`manually <howto/admin/https/manual>`.

To enable HTTPS via letsencrypt::

    sudo tljh-config set https.enabled true
    sudo tljh-config set https.letsencrypt.email you@example.com
    sudo tljh-config add-item https.letsencrypt.domains yourhub.yourdomain.edu

where ``you@example.com`` is your email address and ``yourhub.yourdomain.edu``
is the domain where your hub will be running.

Once you have loaded this, your config should look like::

    sudo tljh-config show

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    https:
      enabled: true
      letsencrypt:
        email: you@example.com
        domains:
        - yourhub.yourdomain.edu

Finally, you can reload the proxy to load the new configuration::

    sudo tljh-config reload proxy

At this point, the proxy should negotiate with Let's Encrypt to set up a
trusted HTTPS certificate for you. It may take a moment for the proxy to
negotiate with Let's Encrypt to get your certificates, after which you can
access your Hub securely at https://yourhub.yourdomain.edu.

These certificates are valid for 3 months. The proxy will automatically
renew them for you before they expire.

.. _howto/admin/https/manual:

Manual HTTPS with existing key and certificate
==============================================

You may already have an SSL key and certificate.
If so, you can tell your deployment to use these files::

    sudo tljh-config set https.enabled true
    sudo tljh-config set https.tls.key /etc/mycerts/mydomain.key
    sudo tljh-config set https.tls.cert /etc/mycerts/mydomain.cert


Once you have loaded this, your config should look like::

    sudo tljh-config show


.. sourcecode:: yaml

    https:
      enabled: true
      tls:
        key: /etc/mycerts/mydomain.key
        cert: /etc/mycerts/mydomain.cert

Finally, you can reload the proxy to load the new configuration::

    sudo tljh-config reload proxy

and now access your Hub securely at https://yourhub.yourdomain.edu.

Troubleshooting
===============

If you're having trouble with HTTPS, looking at the :ref:`traefik
proxy logs <troubleshooting/logs/traefik>` might help.
