Configure resources available to users
======================================

To configure the resources that are available to your users (such as RAM, CPU
and Disk Space), see the section :ref:`tljh-set-user-limits`. For information
on **resizing** the environment available to users *after* you've created your
JupyterHub, see :ref:`howto/admin/resize`.
