Server Requirements
===================

Operating System
================

We require using Ubuntu 18.04 as the base operating system for your server.

Root access
===========

Full ``root`` access to this server is required. This might be via ``sudo``
(recommended) or by direct access to ``root`` (not recommended!)

External IP
===========

An external IP allows users on the internet to reach your JupyterHub. Most
VPS / Cloud providers give you a public IP address along with your server. If
you are hosting on a physical machine somewhere, talk to your system administrators
about how to get HTTP traffic from the world into your server.

CPU / Memory / Disk Space
=========================
