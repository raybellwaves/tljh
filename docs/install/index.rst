The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH) can run on any server that is running at least
**Ubuntu 18.04**. Earlier versions of Ubuntu are not supported.
We have a bunch of tutorials to get you started.

Tutorials to create a new server from scratch on a cloud provider & run TLJH
on it. These are **recommended** if you do not have much experience setting up
servers.
